<h1>Goldilocks and the Three Bears</h1>

<h2>by Robert Southey</h2>

<hr>


<p>
  Once upon a time there were three bears: Father Bear, Mother
  Bear and Baby Bear. Father Bear was very big. Baby Bear was very
  small. Mother Bear was not very big and not very small – she was
  middle sized. The three bears lived in a little house in the forest. 
</p>

<p>
  Every day the bears ate porridge for breakfast. One day Father
  Bear said in his deep Father Bear voice, “Our porridge is too hot.
  We can go and walk in the forest while it is getting cool.” So the
  three bears went out for a walk in the forest. At the same time,
  somebody else was walking in the forest. A little girl with golden
  hair. Do you know her name? It was Goldilocks. She was called
  Goldilocks because her hair was the colour of gold.
</p>

<p>
  Goldilocks saw the bears’ house. She walked up the path and
  knocked on the door. “Nqo-nqo-nqo.” There was no answer. She
  peeped in through the window – it looked very nice inside. She rang
  the bell, but there was no answer. So do you know what Goldilocks
  did? Yes, she walked into the bears’ house! Oh, Goldilocks!
</p>

<p>
  Goldilocks saw the porridge on the table. There was a big bowl for
  Father Bear, a middle-sized bowl for Mother Bear and a small bowl
  for Baby Bear. Goldilocks was very hungry. First she tasted Father
  Bear’s porridge, but she did not like it because it was too salty. “I
  don’t like this porridge, it’s too salty,” Goldilocks said. Then she
  tasted Mother Bear’s porridge, but she did not like it at all because
  it was too sweet – there was too much sugar in it. “I don’t like
  this porridge, it’s too sweet,” Goldilocks said. Next she tasted Baby
  Bear’s porridge. “Mmm,” she said, “I like this porridge, it is just
  right!” And she ate all Baby Bear’s porridge. 
</p>

<p>
  Goldilocks looked around and she saw three chairs. First she sat
  in Father Bear’s chair but it was too hard. She got off the chair
  and said, “I don’t like this chair, it’s too hard.” Next, Goldilocks
  sat in Mother Bear’s chair but it was too soft. She got off the chair
  and said, “I don’t like this chair, it’s too soft.” And then Goldilocks
  sat on Baby Bear’s chair and it was just right. She said, “I like this
  chair, it’s just right!” But do you know what happened? Goldilocks
  was too big for the chair and the chair broke and Goldilocks fell
  onto the floor. Oh dear, poor Goldilocks and poor Baby Bear’s
  chair! 
</p>

<p>
  Goldilocks was tired now, and she wanted to sleep. Where was
  she going to sleep? Can she sleep on the table? No! Can she
  sleep on Baby Bear’s chair? No! Why? Because it is broken. Do
  you know where she is going to sleep? Goldilocks looked for a
  bed to sleep in. She found the bedroom and there she saw three
  beds. Father Bear’s bed was very big. Mother Bear’s bed was
  middle-sized and Baby Bear’s bed was very small.
</p>

<p>
  Goldilocks got into Father Bear’s bed but it was too hard. She
  climbed off the bed and said, “I don’t like this bed, it’s too hard.”
  Next, Goldilocks got onto Mother Bear’s bed but it was too soft.
  She climbed off and said, “I don’t like this bed, it is too soft.”
  And then Goldilocks got onto Baby Bear’s bed. She lay down and
  pulled the blanket up and said, “I like this bed, it’s just right!”
  Goldilocks closed her eyes and went to sleep.
</p>

<p>
  While Goldilocks was asleep, the three bears came home. They
  were hungry. Father Bear looked at his bowl of porridge. He was
  cross and said in his deep Father Bear voice, “Who’s been eating
  my porridge?” Mother Bear looked at her porridge. She was cross
  and she said, “Who’s been eating my porridge?” Baby Bear looked
  at his bowl. He was very cross and he said, “Who’s been eating my
  porridge?” Then he said, “It’s all gone!”
</p>

<p>
  The bears looked at their chairs. Father Bear said, “Who’s been
  sitting on my chair?” Mother Bear said, “Who’s been sitting on my
  chair?” Baby Bear looked at his chair and said, “Who’s been sitting
  in my chair? And look, it’s broken!” 
</p>

<p>
  The bears went into the bedroom. Father Bear looked at his bed
  and said, “Who’s been sleeping in my bed?” Mother Bear looked
  at her bed and said, “Who’s been sleeping in my bed?” Baby Bear
  looked at his bed and said, “Who’s been sleeping in my bed? He
  looked again and said, “There she is!”
</p>

<p>
  Goldilocks got such a fright, she jumped out of bed and ran to the
  window. She climbed out of the window and she ran and ran and
  ran. The three bears never saw Goldilocks again.
